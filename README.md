# Universe-Expansion-Simulator
This Python script simulates the hypothetical expansion of multiple universes in a serial configuration. It incorporates different phases like matter-dominance, dark energy-dominance, and a 'conformal geometry' phase that connects one universe to the next. The simulation then visualizes these expansions using Matplotlib.
